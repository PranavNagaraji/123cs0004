# Notification System Design

---

## Stage 1

### Core Actions

The campus notification platform must support the following actions:

| Action | Actor |
|---|---|
| Fetch all notifications for a logged-in student | Student |
| Fetch unread notifications count | Student |
| Mark a single notification as read | Student |
| Mark all notifications as read | Student |
| Create and broadcast a notification | Admin / HR |
| Fetch notifications filtered by type | Student |
| Subscribe to real-time notifications | Student |

---

### REST API Endpoints

#### 1. Get Notifications for a Student

```
GET /notifications
```

**Headers**
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**Query Parameters**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `string` | No | Filter by `Placement`, `Event`, or `Result` |
| `isRead` | `boolean` | No | Filter by read status |
| `page` | `number` | No | Page number (default: 1) |
| `limit` | `number` | No | Results per page (default: 20) |

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "notif_01",
      "type": "Placement",
      "title": "Google is hiring!",
      "message": "Google has opened applications for SDE-1.",
      "isRead": false,
      "createdAt": "2026-05-09T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 84
  }
}
```

**Response — 401 Unauthorized**
```json
{ "error": "Invalid or expired token" }
```

---

#### 2. Get Unread Notification Count

```
GET /notifications/unread-count
```

**Headers**
```json
{ "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>" }
```

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{ "unreadCount": 12 }
```

---

#### 3. Mark a Single Notification as Read

```
PATCH /notifications/:id/read
```

**Headers**
```json
{ "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>" }
```

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{ "id": "notif_01", "isRead": true }
```

**Response — 404 Not Found**
```json
{ "error": "Notification not found" }
```

---

#### 4. Mark All Notifications as Read

```
PATCH /notifications/read-all
```

**Headers**
```json
{ "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>" }
```

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{ "updated": 12 }
```

---

#### 5. Create and Broadcast a Notification (Admin / HR)

```
POST /notifications
```

**Headers**
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "type": "Placement",
  "title": "Google is hiring!",
  "message": "Google has opened applications for SDE-1.",
  "targetAudience": "all"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `string` | Yes | `Placement`, `Event`, or `Result` |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | Short heading |
| `message` | `string` | Yes | Full notification body |
| `targetAudience` | `string` | Yes | `all` or a specific student ID |

**Response — 201 Created**

### Real-Time Notification Mechanism

#### Options Evaluated

**1. WebSockets**
- Persistent bi-directional connection between client and server
- Best for interactive, high-frequency updates
- Higher server resource usage (one open connection per student)

**2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- Uni-directional: server pushes to client over a persistent HTTP connection
- Simpler than WebSockets — built on standard HTTP, no upgrade protocol
- Clients auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Sufficient for notification delivery (server → client only)

**3. Polling**
- Client calls `GET /notifications` every N seconds
- Simple to implement but wastes bandwidth and increases DB load
- Not suitable at 50,000 active students

#### Recommendation: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE is the right choice for this platform because:
- Notifications are strictly server → client (no need for bi-directional)
- Lower infrastructure overhead than WebSockets
- Built-in browser reconnection handles network drops
- Works over standard HTTP/2 multiplexing

**SSE Endpoint**

```
GET /notifications/stream
```

**Headers**
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt_token>",
  "Accept": "text/event-stream"
}
```

**Server Response Headers**
```
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
```

**Event Payload (pushed by server)**
```
id: notif_03
event: notification
data: {"id":"notif_03","type":"Result","title":"Semester results published","isRead":false,"createdAt":"2026-05-09T11:00:00Z"}
```

When a new notification is created via `POST /notifications`, the server fans it out to all connected SSE clients belonging to the target audience.

## Stage 2

### Database Choice

**PostgreSQL** is the recommended database for this platform.

| Requirement | Why PostgreSQL fits |
|---|---|
| Structured, relational data | Students, notifications, and recipients have clear relationships |
| ACID guarantees | A notification must be atomically stored before it is pushed to clients |
| Complex queries | Filtering by type, read-status, date range, and pagination are standard SQL |
| Enum support | `notificationType` maps directly to a PostgreSQL `ENUM` |
| Scalability tools | Built-in partitioning, indexing, read replicas supported natively |

---

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TYPE notification_type AS ENUM ('Placement', 'Event', 'Result');

CREATE TABLE students (
  id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name        VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email       VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  roll_no     VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at  TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id           UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  type         notification_type NOT NULL,
  title        VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message      TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by   INTEGER REFERENCES students(id),
  created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE notification_recipients (
  id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  notification_id UUID REFERENCES notifications(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  student_id      INTEGER REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_read         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  read_at         TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE (notification_id, student_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_recipients_student ON notification_recipients (student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_recipients_unread  ON notification_recipients (student_id, is_read) WHERE is_read = FALSE;
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_type ON notifications (type);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_created ON notifications (created_at DESC);
```

**Design rationale**: `notifications` stores the message once. `notification_recipients` is the fan-out junction table — one row per student per notification. This avoids duplicating the message content 50,000 times.

---

### Scaling Problems as Data Grows

At 50,000 students and 5,000,000 notifications:

| Problem | Root Cause |
|---|---|
| `notification_recipients` table bloat | 50k rows inserted per broadcast → tens of millions of rows quickly |
| Slow unread-count queries | Full scan of `notification_recipients` per student without a partial index |
| High write throughput on broadcast | 50,000 `INSERT` statements per "Notify All" action |
| Index maintenance overhead | Every insert updates all indexes on the table |
| `ORDER BY createdAt DESC` without index | Full sort on millions of rows |

### Solutions

1. **Partial index on unread**: `WHERE is_read = FALSE` — index shrinks as notifications are read
2. **Table partitioning by `created_at`**: Archive old notifications to cold partitions; queries only touch recent partitions
3. **Bulk insert for fan-out**: Replace 50k individual inserts with a single `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` from a student IDs array
4. **Read replicas**: Route all `GET` queries to a replica; writes go to the primary
5. **Soft-delete / archiving**: Move notifications older than 90 days to an `archived_notifications` table

---

### SQL Queries Mapped to Stage 1 APIs

**GET /notifications** — paginated, filterable

```sql
SELECT
  n.id,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.message,
  nr.is_read,
  n.created_at
FROM notification_recipients nr
JOIN notifications n ON n.id = nr.notification_id
WHERE nr.student_id = $1
  AND ($2::notification_type IS NULL OR n.type = $2)
  AND ($3::boolean IS NULL OR nr.is_read = $3)
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT $4 OFFSET $5;
```

**GET /notifications/unread-count**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS unread_count
FROM notification_recipients
WHERE student_id = $1
  AND is_read = FALSE;
```

**PATCH /notifications/:id/read**

```sql
UPDATE notification_recipients
SET is_read = TRUE, read_at = NOW()
WHERE notification_id = $1
  AND student_id = $2;
```

**PATCH /notifications/read-all**

```sql
UPDATE notification_recipients
SET is_read = TRUE, read_at = NOW()
WHERE student_id = $1
  AND is_read = FALSE;
```

**POST /notifications** — fan-out insert

```sql
INSERT INTO notifications (type, title, message, created_by)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
RETURNING id;

INSERT INTO notification_recipients (notification_id, student_id)
SELECT $1, id FROM students;
```
